# Social Media Sentiment Analysis Project
This project collects customer social media posts using Twitter API, cleans the data by removing irrelevant information and converting it into the appropriate format, organizes data in databases by using PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to classify texts as positive, negative or neutral.

## Data Pipeline
The data pipeline involves 5 steps:

**1. Extract tweets with Tweepy API**: Tweets are extracted from Twitter using Tweepy API.

**2. Load tweets in MongoDB**: Extracted tweets are stored in a MongoDB.

**3. Perform sentiment analysis and load data in a PostgresDB**: Tweets are extracted from MongoDB, sentiment analysis is performed on the tweets, and the transformed data is loaded into a PostgresDB using an ETL job.

**4 Load tweets and corresponding sentiment assessment in a PostgresDB**: The tweets and their corresponding sentiment assessment are loaded into a PostgresDB.

**5. Post data in a Slack channel with a Slack bot**: The data is extracted from the PostgresDB and posted in a Slack channel using a Slack bot.
